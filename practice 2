 # PROJECT 4


 If temperature is greater than 30
   it's a hot day
 otherwise if it's less than 10
 it's a cold day
 otherwise
 it's a neither hot nor cold

Important things:
Temperature>30 [greater than 30]
temperature<30 [less than 30]
temperature >= 30[greater than equal to 30]
temperature <=30[less than equal to 30]
temperature == 30 [equal to 30]
temperature !=30 [not equal to 30]


# PROJECT 5
Important things:
len(variable) = TO count  character


# PROJECT 6
changes given weight to pounds or kilos according the user instruction
IMP : 1) weight = int(input("weight") [here -int- is written to convert user input string to int ]
convert string to int

# PROJECT 7
While loop
always care about the placement of the line[guesses_made += 1]

# PROJECT 8 // CAR GAME

my version but wrong.......
user = input('write: ')
i = 0
while i<1:
if user.lower() or user.upper() == "help":
    print('start = To start the car')
    print('stop = To stop the car ')
    print('quite = To exit')
elif user.lower() or user.upper() =="start":
    print("Car started... Ready to go!")
elif user.lower() or user.upper() =="stop":
    print("Car stopped")
elif user.lower() or user.upper() =="quit":
     break
else:
    print("I don't understand that")

## PROJECT 9 // for loops

for loops is used to complete the task at some limit, like in -rang-bracket

it holds value at the same variable

## PROJECTS 10// NESTED LOOP
 == Nested loop is used for making loop under another loop
 == It's a just a using for loop inside other for loop


## PROJECTS 11// LISTS
We use lists to store list of items and we can modify those  item as our need

## PROJECTS 12// Tuples
We use tuples  to store list of items and we cannot modify those items

## Unpacking
We use unpacking to indicate our item of the list or tuples into different variable within one line

## Dictionaries
 We use dictionaries to indicate our specific meaning of variable or others
